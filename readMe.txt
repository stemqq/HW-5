This assignment is to give you additional experience
working with the jQuery UI and to pull together much of what weâ€™ve
been doing throughout the semester. You are to implement a bit of the
game of Scrabble using drag-and-drop. The idea is to display one
line of the Scrabble board (one line sample) to the user along with
seven letter tiles on a tile rack. The user then drags tiles to the board
to make a word, and you are to report his or her score, taking the letter
values and bonus squares into consideration.

I have been able to work the drag and drop but I have failed to have the letters
display. that is; you can drag and drop the tile image but you are unable to tell 
which letter until you click on the ok button. after you click on the ok button, you 
will know what letters you are dragging and dropping. if you get a right match up, the
the total score works too.
